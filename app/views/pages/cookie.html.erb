    <p class="light">A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing information about the website itself,
      a unique identifier that allows the site to recognize your web browser when you return,
      additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</p>
